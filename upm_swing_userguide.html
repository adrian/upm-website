<h2 id="config_file">Where is UPM's Config File</h2>
<p>
    UPM's configuration file is named <i>upm.properties</i>. It's location it dependant on the version of UPM you're using.
</p>
<p>
    In UPM 1.9 and earlier it's located in your home directory.
</p>
<p>
    In UPM 1.10 and later it's location is dependant on your operating system.
    <ul>
      <li>On Windows it remains in the same location as before, your home directory.</li>
      <li>On OS X it's located in <i>&lt;HOME DIR&gt;/Library/Preferenecs/</i>.</li>
      <li>On Linux it's located in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.config. If you've not explicity configured XDG_CONFIG_HOME them it defaults to your home directory so the full path is <i>&lt;HOME DIR&gt;/.config/</i>.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2 id="database_syncing">Database Syncing</h2>
<p>
    See <a href="database_syncing.html">Database Syncing</a> for an overview of this feature.
</p>

<h2 id="sync_using_dropbox">Using Dropbox</h2>
<p>
  To sync from one computer to another save your database file in your Dropbox folder. If you plan to sync to an Android device create the folder <tt><Dropbox Root>/Apps/UPM</tt> and save your database there. See <a href="upm_android_userguide.html#sync_using_dropbox">Sync Using Dropbox on Android</a> for more details.
</p>
</p>
  When you make a change the database will be automatically saved and sync'd to your other machines. If you have a database open and a new version comes in over Dropbox UPM will alert you and ask if you'd like to load the new version.
</p>

<h2 id="sync_using_http">Using a HTTP Server</h2>
<p>
    See <a href="database_syncing.html#sync_http">Sync Using HTTP</a> for instructions on how to prepare your HTTP server.
</p>
<p>
    There are generally two scenarios you can find yourself in terms of syncing. The first is where you have a password database on your PC that you'd like to upload to your server and make available for syncing to other devices. The second is where there's a password database already on your server and you'd like to sync it to your PC.
</p>
<b>1. Uploading a database</b>
<ol>
    <li>Open your database, <i>Database -> Open Database</i></li>
    <li>Select <i>Database -> Database Properties</i></li>
    <li>In the URL field enter the URL of your remote location. If you put the upload.php file at http://www.mydomain.com/upm/upload.php then enter http://www.mydomain.com/upm in the URL field. If this URL is password protected with basic authentication then select the account in your database that has the relevant username and password.</li>
</ol>
<b>2. Downloading a database</b>
<ol>
    <li>Select <i>Database -> Open Database from URL</i></li>
    <li>Enter the URL of your database, e.g. http://www.mydomain.com/upm/upm.db. If the URL is protected with basic authentication enter the username and password. When all relevant fields are populated click <i>OK</i></li>
    <li>The next dialog is titled <i>Save Database As...</i> and is asking where you'd like to save the downloaded database to. Select a dir, enter a file name and click <i>Save</i>.</li>
    <li>Finally, to open the downloaded database you'll be prompted to enter it's master password.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    When the text "Revision x - Unsynchronised" appears in red in the status bar this means that your local and remote databases may by out of sync. To synchronise them press the <i>Synchronise</i> button or the select the menu item <i>Database -> Sync with Remote Database</i>. When the databases are in sync the status bar will read "Revision x - Synchronised".
</p>


<h2 id="export_to_csv">Export to CSV</h2>
WARNING: Be extremely careful with your exported CSV file. It contains the entire contents of encrypted database in plain text.
<ul>
    <li>Select <i>Database -> Export</i></li>
    <li>Enter the name of the file you want to</li> 
</ul>


<h2 id="import_from_csv">Import from CSV</h2>
<p>
The UPM import CSV should be structured as follows,
<pre>account name,user id,password,url,notes</pre>
Example: <pre>flickr,testuser,testpassword,http://www.flickr.com,some test notes</pre>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Open the database you'd like to import the CSV file into</li>   
    <li>Select <i>Database -> Import</i></li>
    <li>Select the CSV file to import and click <i>Open</i></li>
</ul>
If an account in the CSV file exists in the database you'll be prompted for the action to take.


<h2 id="add_trusted_https_cert">How to Add a Trusted HTTPS Certificate</h2>
<p>
    <b>NOTE:</b>Since 1.12 you can choose to trust all self signed certificates rather than updating your keystore. While this is a much easier option it's not enabled by default as some may not like the security implications. To enable this setting use the "Accept Self-Signed Certificates" checkbox in the options dialog.
</p>
<p>
    If you use a HTTPS URL for your remote database and the server is using a self signed certificate you may get this error when you try and sync,
</p>
<p>
    <i>javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target.</i>
</p>
<p>
    What you need to do is add the server's certificate to your trusted certificate keystore. Here's how,
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Open a command prompt and cd to the directory where UPM is installed (on OS X this will be something like <tt>&lt;install dir&gt;/UPM.app/Contents/Resources/Java</tt>).</li>
    <li>Execute <tt>java -classpath upm.jar InstallCert &lt;hostname&gt;</tt>. hostname is the host where your database is hosted. e.g. if your db is at https://www.mydomain.com/dir1/upm.db then the hostname is www.mydomain.com</li>
    <li>When prompted hit enter (to accept the default option)</li>
    <li><p>There should now be a file called <i>jssecacerts</i> in the current directory. Move this file into the <tt>./lib/security/</tt> directory of your Java runtime environment. e.g. <tt>sudo mv jssecacerts &lt;jre_dir&gt;/lib/security/</tt>
    </p>
    <p>
      On OS X your JRE will be located somewhere like <tt>/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.6.0/Home</tt>.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Ubuntu enter <tt>update-alternatives --display java</tt> to return the full path to your JRE.
    </p>
    </li>
</ul>
