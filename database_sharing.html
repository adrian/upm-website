<h2>Database Sharing</h2>
<p>
    Database sharing came about because I needed a way of keeping my database in sync across multiple machines. It works by allowing you to upload/download your database to/from a HTTP/HTTPS location.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
    You'll need your own webserver capable of hosting <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP">PHP</a> scripts. If you don't already have one you'll need to purchase a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_hosting_service">web hosting service</a>. A quick google for "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=web+hosting">web hosting</a>" should throw up quite a few options.
</p>
<p>
    The webserver should be accessible from each machine and device you want to share the database between.
</p>

<h3>Server Side Steps</h3>
<p>
    At present UPM supports HTTP and HTTPS. The URL can be password protected by basic authentication. 
</p>
<p>
    Two PHP files are required on the webserver, <b>deletefile.php</b> and <b>upload.php</b>. Both of these files come packaged with the desktop version of UPM in the <b>.\server\http</b> directory. Alternatively they can be downloaded directly from <a href="https://github.com/adrian/upm-swing/tree/master/server/http">here</a>.
</p>

<h3>Client Side Steps</h3>
<ul>
    <li><a href="upm_android_userguide.html#database_sharing">Android version of UPM</a></li>
    <li><a href="upm_swing_userguide.html#database_sharing">Desktop version of UPM</a></li>
</ul>
