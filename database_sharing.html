<h2>Database Sharing</h2>
<p>
    Database sharing came about because I needed a way of keeping my database in sync across multiple machines. It works by allowing you to upload/download your database to/from a HTTP/HTTPS location.
</p>

<h3>Server Side Steps</h3>
<p>
    To use database sharing you'll need access to a webserver accessible from each of the machines and devices you want to share the database between. The server should support PHP.
</p>
<p>
    At present UPM supports HTTP and HTTPS. The URL can be password protected by basic authentication. 
</p>
<p>
    Two PHP files are required on the webserver, <b>deletefile.php</b> and <b>upload.php</b>. Both of these files come packaged with the desktop version of UPM in the <b>.\server\http</b> directory. Alternatively they can be downloaded directly from <a href="https://github.com/adrian/upm-swing/tree/master/server/http">here</a>.

<h3>Client Side Steps</h3>
